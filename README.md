# Horse Inspector

## What is it?
Horse Inspector is a simple Spigot/Craftbukkit mod which allows players to acquire data about horses' speed, hp, jump height, and tamer without having to build in-game contraptions to test them. Also works on Donkeys, Mules, Llamas, and Skeleton Horses.

## How to install/use the mod
See the [wiki](https://github.com/AnomalyTea/Horse-Inspector/wiki) page for instructions on how to install, configure, and use the mod.

## Bug Reports & Feature Suggestions
For bug reports, feature suggestions, etc, please [open an issue](https://github.com/AnomalyTea/Horse-Inspector/issues) on GitHub.

## How to get started with the code
There are no out-of-the-ordinary dependencies. Simply open up your editor of choice (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.) and add the Spigot API as an external library, as you would for any other Spigot mod.
