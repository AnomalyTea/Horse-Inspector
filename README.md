# Horse Inspector

## What is it?
Horse Inspector is a simple Spigot/Craftbukkit mod which allows players to acquire data about horses' speed, hp, jump height, and tamer without having to build in-game contraptions to test them. Also works on Donkeys and Llamas.

## How to use (Players)
Hit a horse with a stick. No damage will occur, and the server will send you the horse's speed, max hp, jump height, and name of the player who tamed the horse.

## How to use (Server Admins)
Download Horse_Inspector.jar from the GitHub [releases page](https://github.com/AnomalyTea/Horse-Inspector/releases), and drop it into your server's Plugin directory. No further configuration is necessary.
